# Public data refresh

## Configuration (2026-09-27)

- Google Cloud project: `borderpulse-493414`.
- Cloud Scheduler job: `us-central1/borderpulse-refresh`.
- Schedule: `7,22,37,52 * * * *`, timezone `Etc/UTC`.
- HTTPS POST to the GitHub `fetch-cbp.yml` workflow dispatch endpoint;
  body `{"ref":"main"}`. The existing writer validates and commits the CBP
  snapshot, then explicitly dispatches the Pages deployer.
- Existing GitHub cron remains a fallback, not evidence of timely delivery.
- Fine-grained GitHub token: `borderpulse-cloud-scheduler`, restricted to
  `sbc1-code/borderpulse`, Actions read/write and required Metadata read.
  Expires **2026-12-26**. Renew before that date and replace the Scheduler
  Authorization header. Never commit or paste the token into project docs.
- One Scheduler job uses the billing account's three-job free allowance;
  check account-wide allocation before adding more jobs. GitHub standard
  runners are free for this public repository. Maps remains disabled.

## Verify the full path

1. Scheduler's last execution succeeds on a scheduled quarter-hour.
2. A corresponding GitHub `workflow_dispatch` fetch run succeeds.
3. Its explicitly dispatched Pages deployment succeeds.
4. `https://borderpulse.com/data/crossings.json` has the new `fetched_at`
   and nonempty crossing data. A successful dispatch alone is insufficient.

The dashboard subscribes to snapshot changes, checks every five minutes,
and checks again when its tab becomes visible. Connection failures retain
the last successful snapshot with its original timestamp. The source's
individual lane update times can be older than the site's fetch time.

## Recovery and costs

If refresh stops, inspect Scheduler delivery errors, token expiry, the
fetch run, and the Pages deployment in that order. A manual workflow dispatch
can restore a snapshot while the trigger is repaired. Pause this Scheduler
job to stop its dispatches; the existing GitHub schedule remains available.

Do not reactivate paid Maps or add recurring services until revenue supports
them and Sebastian authorizes the expense.
